## LeverApp

My very first tkinter App to create a GUI!
Inspired by the Emperor's New Groover, users can input their names, and be asked to pull the lever!

## Greeting Assignment

The objective of this assignment is to create a 
simple greeting application using Python's Tkinter library. 
The application should allow users to input their name, 
select their preferred language for the greeting, 
and display a personalized greeting message.

Requirements:

1. Create a GUI application using Tkinter that includes the following components:
   - Label prompting the user to enter their name.
   - Entry widget for users to input their name.
   - Label prompting the user to select their preferred language.
   - Combobox (dropdown menu) for users to select their preferred language from a list of options (e.g., English, French, Spanish).
   - Button labeled "Greet Me" that, when clicked, generates a personalized greeting message based on the user's input.

2. Implement functionality to display a greeting message based on the user's input:
   - When the "Greet Me" button is clicked, the application should generate a greeting message that includes the user's name and is displayed in the selected language.

3. Apply styling and formatting to the GUI components to enhance the visual appeal of the application:
   - Use appropriate font styles, sizes, and colors for labels, entry widgets, combobox, button, and greeting message.
